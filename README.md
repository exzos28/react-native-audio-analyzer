## Installation 🚀

```bash
npm install react-native-audio-analyzer react-native-nitro-modules
# or
yarn add react-native-audio-analyzer react-native-nitro-modules
```

> **Note**: `react-native-nitro-modules` is required as this library relies on [Nitro Modules](https://nitro.margelo.com/).

### iOS Setup

```bash
cd ios && pod install
# or
bundle exec pod install
```

## Usage 🎶

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { computeAmplitude } from 'react-native-audio-analyzer';

// Analyze audio file and get amplitude data
const amplitudeData = computeAmplitude('/path/to/audio.mp3', 1000);
console.log('Amplitude data:', amplitudeData);
```

### Example

📦 Full usage example can be found in the [example](./example) directory.

## API Reference 📚

### `load(url: string): Promise<string>`

Load and cache audio file.

#### Parameters

- `url` (string): Url to the audio file to be cached

#### Returns

- `Promise<string>`: Promise with absolute file system path to cached file.

#### Example

```typescript
const path = load('https://file-examples.com/storage/fe180a8b03688f5559b9baf/2017/11/file_example_MP3_1MG.mp3', 500);
// Returns: /data/user/0/audioanalyzer.example/cache/9349e0a758090499d982e320a10273ab.audio
```

---

### `computeAmplitude(filePath: string, outputSampleCount: number): number[]`

Analyzes an audio file and returns an array of amplitude values.

#### Parameters

- `filePath` (string): Path to the audio file to analyze
- `outputSampleCount` (number): Number of amplitude samples to generate

#### Returns

- `number[]`: Array of amplitude values between 0 and 1

#### Example

```typescript
const amplitudes = computeAmplitude(path, 500);
// Returns: [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.2, ...] (500 values)
```

## Supported Audio Formats 🎼

This library supports various audio formats through the miniaudio library:

- **Lossy**: MP3, AAC, OGG Vorbis, Opus
- **Lossless**: FLAC, WAV, AIFF
- **Other**: WMA, M4A, and more

## Performance Considerations ⚡

- The library uses native C++ code for optimal performance
- Audio processing is done efficiently with minimal memory usage
- Large audio files are processed in chunks to maintain responsiveness
- Consider using appropriate `outputSampleCount` values based on your visualization needs
